# SliceSampling
This package implements slice sampling algorithms. 
Slice sampling finds its roots in the Swendsenâ€“Wang algorithm for Ising models[^SW1987][^ES1988].
It later came into the interest of the statistical community through Besag and Green[^BG1993], and popularized by Neal [^N2003].
Furthermore, Neal introduced various ways to efficiently implement slice samplers.
This package provides the original slice sampling algorithms by Neal and their later extensions.
